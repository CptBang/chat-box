## ChatBox

**Description:**
This is a very in-depth paragraph about the project.
Influenced by other Unity projects using ChatGPT, I wanted to use the OpenAI API and make a 
way for to easily create and save a profile that a user can chat with. Made with Python, mostly
 for easy API usage, but then I just went with it and did the frontend in PySide6 while I was at it.
Also ended up throwing in TTS via ElevenLabs which is pretty cool, and fun to play around with.

In order to use ChatBox (or whatever name this changes to later), you do need your own API keys. 
I plan on implementing other LLm models later, but for now it uses ChatGPT. If you desperately want to 
try it out and don't have access to the OpenAI API, shoot me a message. You should be able to add them
on first-time use, or you can add them later through Settings.

Other than the ToDo list, other features will probably be added, but this was more of a playground for me
so I could implement ChatGPT into Unity with chattable NPCs. Feel free to report any bugs, as I'm sure
there are an infinite amount of them, just know that I definitely will not get to it right away.

**ToDo:**
- Add documentation
- Implement better voice recognition
- Create onboarding process
- Option to see the number of tokens used
- Make sure memory functions work (pretty untested)
- Option to edit the profiles after creation
- Make voice settings actually do something
